# What-City-Should-I-Move-To
Comparing the cities I like the most in the US considering their employment rate and the earning I would have. For earning I have considered it as the income minus the median rent.
I have assumed that all other costs of living are constant, or at least, non-significant

Notice from this graph that the best choices are Pittsburgh and Boston since they have a high employment rate and a high income.
