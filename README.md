# What-City-Should-I-Move-To
Comparing the cities I like the most in the US considering their employment rate and the earning I would have. For earning I have considered it as the income minus the median rent.

## Assumptions
    All other costs are the same in every city
    The employment rate is the same for graduate students than general population

    

Notice from this graph that the best choices are Pittsburgh and Boston since they have a high employment rate and a high income.
